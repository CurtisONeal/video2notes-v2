"""Reading keyframes: local OCR first, a vision model only where OCR isn't enough.

Two tiers, because they have wildly different economics:

* **OCR** is free and local. On macOS the Vision framework is fast, good on code
  and UI, and costs nothing — so it runs on every keyframe unconditionally.
* **A vision model** is metered API spend, per image, and cannot use the
  subscription backend: `claude-cli` runs with `Read` disabled (the
  prompt-injection guard for untrusted source content), so images cannot be
  handed to it without reopening exactly that hole. Vision therefore escalates
  only for frames OCR cannot explain — diagrams, charts, plots, UI layouts,
  where reading the glyphs is not the same as understanding the picture.

That ordering is the whole cost story. Reading every frame with a frontier
model runs roughly $0.70-0.80 per video; OCR-first with selective escalation
usually lands in cents, because most slides *are* mostly text.
