"""Content-shape profiles for visual extraction.

The right settings for reading a video's screen depend on what kind of video it
is, and the differences are not marginal. Measured on real content:

    animated explainer (3Blue1Brown)   24 frames   ~3 OCR words   100% escalate
    lecture w/ slides (Karpathy)       17 frames    35 OCR words    29% escalate
    software walkthrough (Postman)      8 frames    82 OCR words    37% escalate

Three genuinely different shapes. A single global threshold serves one of them
and mis-serves the rest: 0.3 (tuned for hard slide cuts) yielded *two* frames
from a 19-minute animated explainer, while the Postman screencast over-fires
scene detection on cursor movement and needs aggressive de-duplication instead.

Selection is deliberately ordered cheapest-and-most-certain first:

    explicit --profile  >  source map  >  probe  >  default

The **probe** is the interesting one, and it reuses the pipeline's central
trick: OCR is free, so use it to decide how to spend money. Sample a handful of
already-extracted frames, read them, and let the OCR yield say what kind of
video this is — dense text means a UI or slide deck, sparse text means the
picture is carrying the meaning.

Deliberate scope limit: a profile never changes *extraction* thresholds when it
came from the probe, because the probe needs extracted frames to classify and
re-extracting to apply its own answer would double the work for a guess. Probe
results tune only the paid decisions (escalation, budget, model). Extraction
thresholds move only on an explicit --profile or a source-map hit, where the
answer is known before any frame is pulled.
